## What should I know before I get started?

### Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to [opensource+desktop@github.com](mailto:opensource+desktop@github.com).

### The Roadmap

GitHub Desktop recently announced its
[1.0 release](https://github.com/blog/2437-announcing-github-desktop-1-0) and
are working towards deprecating the classic Mac and Windows applications.

Beyond that, we are working on a roadmap you can read [here](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/master/docs/process/roadmap.md).
The immediate milestones are more detailed, and the latter milestones are more
fuzzy and subject to change.

If you have ideas or suggestions please read the
[Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements) section below to understand
how to contribute your feedback.

### Help Wanted

As part of building GitHub Desktop, we'll identify tasks that are good for
external contributors to pick up. These tasks:

 - have low impact, or have a known workaround
 - should be addressed
 - have a narrow scope and/or easy reproduction steps
 - can be worked on independent of other tasks

These issues will be labelled as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/labels/help%20wanted)

comment on the issue to let the core team (and the community) know you are
